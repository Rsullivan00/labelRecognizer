Meeting April 7th:
1)In the case where we have multiple center contours returned, choose more intelligently by Choosing a contour that easily approximates to a rectangle
2)Save final transformed image or print the approximation rectangle
3)Current solution does a good job of finding contour, but we should take that area from the ORIGINAL image, and process that for final label extraction.

Ideas April 5th:
Problem cases:
1) Inverted color schemes
2) Faded background, trying sharpening (ask Nate)
3) Try machine learning for categorization (feature extraction)
    Look at histograms of images, characterize histograms based on common features
